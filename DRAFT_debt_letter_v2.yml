question: |
  ## DebtSettle can help!
subquestion: |
  If you don't owe the alleged debt, federal law gives you the right to 
  send a letter to the debt collector stating that you dispute the debt.
  
  Usually, the result will be that the debt collector is prohibited
  from trying to collect, until they either (1) give you written proof 
  that you owe the debt or (2) get a court judgment saying you have to pay. 
  
  It's also common for debt collectors to give up on collecting when a debt 
  is disputed in writing. They'd rather go after people that don't assert 
  their rights.

    In addition to the above, I also request the following information 
    in writing, so that I can be fully informed regarding this matter:
      
      
    Why you think I owe the debt and to whom I owe it, including:
      
    * The name and address of the creditor to whom the debt is currently owed, 
    the account number used by that creditor, and the amount owed.
    * If this debt started with a different creditor, provide the 
    name and address of the original creditor, the account number 
    used by that creditor, and the amount owed to that creditor at 
    the time it was transferred. When you identify the original creditor, 
    please provide any other name by which I might know them, if that 
    is different from the official name. In addition, tell me when the 
    current creditor obtained the debt and who the current creditor 
    obtained it from.
    * Provide verification and documentation that there is a valid basis
    for claiming that I am required to pay the debt to the current creditor. 
    For example, can you provide a copy of the written agreement that 
    created my original requirement to pay?
    * If you are asking that I pay a debt that somebody else is or 
    was required to pay, identify that person. Provide verification 
    and documentation about why this is a debt that I am required to pay.
    
    
    The amount and age of the debt, including:
      
    * A copy of the last billing statement sent to me by the original creditor.
    * State the amount of the debt when you obtained it, and the date that you obtained it.
    * If there have been any additional interest, fees or charges 
    added since the last billing statement from the original creditor, 
    provide an itemization showing the dates and amount of each added 
    amount. In addition, explain how the added interest, fees or other 
    charges are expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt 
    or are permitted by law.
    * If there have been any payments or other reductions since the 
    last billing statement from the original creditor, provide an 
    itemization showing the dates and amount of each of them.
    * If there have been any other changes or adjustments since the 
    last billing statement from the original creditor, please provide 
    full verification and documentation of the amount you are trying 
    to collect. Explain how that amount was calculated. In addition, 
    explain how the other changes or adjustments are expressly authorized 
    by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law.
    * State when the creditor claims this debt became due and when 
    it became delinquent.
    * Identify the date of the last payment made on this account.
    * Have you made a determination that this debt is within the 
    statute of limitations applicable to it? State when you think 
    the statute of limitations expires for this debt, and how you 
    made that determination.
    
    
    Details about your authority to collect this debt:
    
    * I would like more information about your firm before I discuss
    the debt with you. Does your firm have a debt collection license
    from my state? If not, explain why not. If so, provide the date of the
    license, the name on the license, the license number, and the name,
    address and telephone number of the state agency issuing the license.
    * If you are contacting me from a place outside my state, does your
    firm have a debt collection license from that place? If so, provide
    the date of the license, the name on the license, the license number,
    and the name, address and telephone number of the state agency issuing
    the license.
    
    
    I have asked for this information because I have some questions. I must hear from you to make an informed decision about your claim
    that I owe this money. I am open to communicating with you for this
    purpose. In order to make sure that I am not put at any disadvantage,
    in the meantime please treat this debt as being in dispute and under
    discussion between us.
